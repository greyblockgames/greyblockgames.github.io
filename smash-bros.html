<body><p>I love all of you. Every main, every secondary, every casual, every PMDT member, every pro, every
competitive player. You are all fantastic, and for that, I present my contribution to this fantastic
game, and every aspect of it. I cannot Stress this enough. Everyone who plays Project M, give yourselves
a round of thunderous applause. You deserve it.
Enjoy. This is hundreds of hours of work, between making skins, modding in stages and stage skins,
adding CSPs etc, making CSPs etc, fixing bugs, and just about everything you can think of. From the
bottom of my heart: Have yourself a damn fine time Everyone.
Special thanks to my bug testers, you know who you are, and so will everyone else, there's a readme.txt
in the root of the build.
Thanks to everyone for making the skins and textures that appear in this build, you are the power behind
the modding community.
Thanks to everyone who downloaded 3.6, the original version, even though compared to this it was pretty
bad. You guys are great. Thanks to all you in Norway who really like it(?). It's amazing what this
subreddit can do to bring people together.
Thank you to Ethan and Emory Scott, for getting me into the competitive scene, you guys have claimed
hours of my time and I love you for it.
And lastly, thank you to Cimo, for being there in that room with me while I tinkered away on my Mac
(which is clearly not meant to mod PM but I did it anyway. Bill gates can eat his heart out.) I love you
buddy, stay Fuzzy.

<p>"Our Build is centred around tournament legality, and thus, no movesets have been changed.
    Our build contains a handful of cool features such as a custom versus menu (courtesy of Thetyah)
    and custom skins." • Midnight_B1u3

<p>"An awesome build made by some awesome people. 100% legal which means that the people coming
to my tournaments are able to enjoy the changes without worrying about being impacted in
a negative way!" • Gabe T.
